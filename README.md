# CS2-TextUtility-Marwan-Kareem
This project is a simple text utility library written in C++ that performs basic string manipulation operations using C-style strings (char[] and char*). The wordCount function counts the number of words in a string, while charCount returns the number of characters excluding the null terminator. countVowelsAndConsonants calculates how many vowels and consonants are present. reverseString modifies the input string by reversing its characters in place. The palindrome function checks whether a string reads the same forwards and backwards. convert_to_upper and convert_to_lower convert all alphabetic characters to uppercase or lowercase, respectively. Lastly, substringcount counts how many times a specific substring appears within the main string.
